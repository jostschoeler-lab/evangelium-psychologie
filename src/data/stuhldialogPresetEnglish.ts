That is how fear loses its power—not because it vanishes immediately, but because you learn to be secure in me even while it is still present. Remember Paul: he asked that the messenger of Satan be removed. I answered, ‘My grace is sufficient for you.’ Afterwards Paul could even rejoice in his weakness, for then my strength rested on him all the more.",
